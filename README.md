# Plant Disease Detection Project

## Overview
This repository contains a web-based application and supporting notebooks for detecting plant diseases using machine learning. The project utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow model to identify various plant diseases from images, facilitating quick and accurate diagnostics.

### Files in this Repository:
- **`app.py`**: A Python script for a web application that uses Dash to provide a user-friendly interface for plant disease detection.
- **`Image_Detection.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the setup, training, and evaluation of the image detection model.
- **`Test_Plant_Diseases.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook focused on testing the trained model and visualizing its performance.

## Features
- **Web-based Prediction**: The web app allows users to upload an image of a plant leaf, and the model predicts the disease.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning-based image classification.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical insights into the model's performance and predictions.
